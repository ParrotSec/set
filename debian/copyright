 Feel free to modify, use, change, market, do whatever you 
 want with it as long as you give the appropriate credit 
 where credit is due (which means giving the authors the 
 credit they deserve for writing it).

 Also note that by using this software, if you ever see the creator of SET
 in a bar, you should (optional) give him a hug and should (optional) buy
 him a beer (or bourbon - hopefully bourbon). Author has the option to
 refuse the hug (most likely will never happen) or the beer or bourbon
 (also most likely will never happen). Also by using this tool (these are
 all optional of course!), you should try to make this industry better, try
 to stay positive, try to help others, try to learn from one another, try
 stay out of drama, try offer free hugs when possible (and make sure
 recipient agrees to mutual hug), and try to do everything you can to be
 awesome.
